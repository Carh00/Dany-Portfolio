                          <br> Soft skills: <br>
                            My softer skills are being able to communicate and work well with others without having
                            problems. I have a good sense of time management trying to get any project finished before
                            deadlines and being a very good problem solver. I also consider myself to have a very good work ethic of trying to finish a job the quickest, but also bringing out the best quality of what is asked from me.
